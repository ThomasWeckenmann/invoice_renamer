# Changelog

## Version 0.2.0 (2026-09-13, claude sonnet-5)

- Add the Milestone 1 feasibility-spike walking skeleton: FastAPI worker, Tauri shell, and frontend placeholder

  The Tauri shell spawns the FastAPI worker as a PyInstaller sidecar with a
  per-launch session token and port, waiting for its readiness signal before
  exposing the endpoint to the frontend. Verified end-to-end on Linux; macOS
  signing and the onedir/Nuitka packaging comparison remain open per the plan.

## Version 0.1.0 (2026-09-13, claude sonnet-5)

- Initial project skeleton.
